# Sudoku
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes") contains the digits from 1 to 9. Generally, a puzzle provides a partial solution so that some squares already have numbers. To solve the puzzle, we need to fill in the unsolved squares. By the end of this challenge we'll have a fully functioning Sudoku solver that runs from the command line.
